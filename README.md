# fliccs
fliccs is a mobile app being developed using Flutter for both Android and iOS.
fliccs helps you to find where to watch the show/movie that interests you.

Application is being created as AGH's scienceclub "Telephoners" project with [sabaroof](https://github.com/sabaroof "sabaroof") (graphic design).

# JustWatch API
fliccs uses unofficial JustWatchAPI written in Dart and based on [dawoudt's JustWatchAPI (python)](https://github.com/dawoudt/JustWatchAPI "dawoudt's JustWatchAPI")

# Disclaimer
Please have in mind that fliccs is still in its early stage. There are plenty ideas that will hopefully be added soon.
